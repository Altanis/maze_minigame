# maze minigame

small, little game hastily coded in 4 hours. i had a dream on a game like this, and so I willed it into existence today

## how to play

it's a party game. the player is blindfolded as their friends help them navigate a maze.
friends may only guide their friends by giving them directions or telling them to stop moving. 
touching a wall causes the player to lose. escaping makes them win.

there are sound effects, so play with sound on. WASD/Arrow Keys to move.
